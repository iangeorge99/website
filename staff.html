        <p>
          Tim brings extensive experience in alternative education and youth-focused programming. His background
          includes serving as a secondary educator and principal in both public and private school settings, where
          he developed and led programs for youth who needed increased structure, accountability, and individualized
          academic support.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tim has created GED and job-training programs, established alternative schools, and developed an
          Alternative to Detention Program in collaboration with juvenile probation. His work centers on building
          structured environments that support academic engagement, responsible decision-making, and positive routines.
